We provide an implementation of a person detection algorithm based on images in Matlab.
Deep leaning training and testing were performed on large person dataset. 

Different classification algorithms were tested and analysed: 

 * SVM with linear and RBF Kernel
 * Neural Netwroks 
 * SVM + PCA 
 * SVM + SVD 
 * Neural Networks + PCA 
 * Neural Networks + SVD

We provide a full report on the findings via [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9xjuFiZNvo4OTQ5WnROYmVlM28/view?usp=sharing)

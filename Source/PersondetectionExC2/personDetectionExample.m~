%            and add it to the path with

%    And make sure you downloaded the train_feats.mat and train_imgs.mat
%    files we provided you with.

%--- WARNING --
% You need to download the Deep Learning Toolbox and add it to your path
% You can get it from https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm/DeepLearnToolbox/archive/master.zip
addpath(genpath('/home/benarbia/Documents/MATLAB/pcmlproject2/Part2/DeepLearnToolbox-master'));

% --- NOTE ---
% Using this toolbox requires that you understand very well neural networks
% and that you go through the examples in their README file (github).
% You may also need to get into the toolbox code to be able to experiment
% with it.
%  
% Make sure you understand what is going on below!

rng(8339);  % fix seed, this    NN is very sensitive to initialization

% setup NN. The first layer needs to have number of features neurons,
%  and the last layer the number of classes (here two).
nn = nnsetup([size(Tr.X,2) 150 150 2]);

opts.numepochs =  100;   %  Number of full sweeps through data
opts.batchsize = 100;  %  Take a mean gradient step over this many samples

% if == 1 => plots trainin error as the NN is trained
opts.plot               = 1; 

nn.learningRate = 2;

% this neural network implementation requires number of samples to be a
% multiple of batchsize, so we remove some for this to be true.
numSampToUse = opts.batchsize * floor( size(Tr.X) / opts.batchsize);
Tr.X = Tr.X(1:numSampToUse,:);
Tr.y = Tr.y(1:numSampToUse);

% normalize data
[Tr.normX, mu, sigma] = zscore(Tr.X); % train, get mu and std

% prepare labels for NN
LL = [1*(Tr.y>0)  1*(Tr.y<0)];  % first column, p(y=1)
                                   % second column, p(y=-1)

[nn, L] = nntrain(nn, Tr.normX, LL, opts);


Te.normX = normalize(Te.X, mu, sigma);  % normalize test data

% to get the scores we need to do nnff (feed-forward)
%  see for example nnpredict().
% (This is a weird thing of this toolbox)
nn.testing = 1;
nn = nnff(nn, Te.normX, zeros(size(Te.normX,1), nn.size(end)));
nn.testing = 0;

% predict on the test set
nnPred = nn.a{end};

% we want a single score, subtract the output sigmoids
nnPred = nnPred(:,1) - nnPred(:,2);

%% See prediction performance
fprintf('Plotting performance..\n');
% let's also see how random predicition does
randPred = rand(size(Te.y));

% and plot all together, and get the performance of each
methodNames = {'Neural Network', 'Random'}; % this is to show it in the legend
avgTPRList = evaluateMultipleMethods( Te.y > 0, [nnPred,randPred], true, methodNames );

% now you can see that the performance of each method
% is in avgTPRList. You can see that random is doing very bad.
avgTPRList

%% visualize samples and their predictions (test set)

% for i=20:30  % just 10 of them, though there are thousands
